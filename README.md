c.	Creating a Data Flow

A data flow diagram (DFD) is a visual representation of how data flows through a system, illustrating the movement of information between various components or processes. In essence, it maps out the paths data takes within the system, from its source to its destination, highlighting the interactions between different entities.

i.	Data Flow Diagram for Food Ordering System:
                      Food Ordering System is actually a type of software that allows the
                       manager of restaurants to manage and accept the placed orders over the 
                        Internet or in the restaurant. Let us understand the working of the food 
                          ordering system by using DFD.

V.	Delivery Status Database

Data Flows:  
I.	User Registration/Login Process:
Data Flow: User inputs (username, password) -> User Database
II.	Menu Browsing Process:
Data Flow: Request for menus -> Restaurant Database
III.	Placing Order Process:
Data Flow: Selected items -> Order Processing
IV.	Payment Process:

V.	Order Confirmation Process:
Data Flow: Confirmation details -> Order Confirmation Database


Here, different levels of DFD are shown for Food Ordering System such as Level 0 DFD, and Level 1 DFD. 
Level 0 DFD –
At this level, the Input and Output of the system are shown. The system is designed and established across the world with input and output at this level.
Description:
I.	The Level 0 DFD represents an overview of the entire system, breaking down the main processes into subprocesses.
II.	It provides a high-level view of the system's functionalities and interactions between processes.

Components:
I.	Processes: The main processes of the system are represented at this level, each further broken down into subprocesses in the subsequent levels.
II.	Data Flows: Data flows between processes, indicating the flow of information within the system.
III.	External Entities: External entities, such as users and external systems, interact with the system through data flows.
Purpose:
I.	The Level 0 DFD serves as a foundation for more detailed diagrams, providing an overview of the system's scope and main processes.
II.	It helps stakeholders understand the overall structure of the system and its interactions with external entities.


Level 1 DFD (Sample):

Description:
I.	The Level 1 DFD expands on the processes identified in the Level 0 DFD, providing more detail and granularity.
II.	It breaks down each main process into its subprocesses, further illustrating the flow of data within the system.
III.	
Components:
i.	Processes: Each main process from the Level 0 DFD is detailed further into its subprocesses, providing a more comprehensive view of the system's functionalities.
ii.	Data Stores: Data stores, where data is stored within the system, are introduced at this level to represent the storage and retrieval of information.
iii.	Data Flows: The data flows between processes and data stores are illustrated in more detail, showing how data moves within the system.

Purpose:
I.	The Level 1 DFD provides a more detailed understanding of the system's processes and data flows compared to the Level 0 DFD.
II.	It helps stakeholders and development teams identify specific tasks and data requirements for each process, facilitating system design and implementation.

Example:
i.	In an online food delivery system, the Level 0 DFD may include processes such as user registration/login, menu browsing, and order processing.
ii.	The Level 1 DFD would then break down the order processing process into subprocesses such as order confirmation, payment processing, and delivery assignment, providing a more detailed view of how orders are handled within the system.

Overall, both Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs play crucial roles in depicting the structure and functionality of a system, with Level 1 DFD offering a more detailed perspective than Level 0.

4.1 Calculation of Functional Point:
   FP (Function Point) calculation is a method used in software engineering to measure the size and complexity of a software system based on the functionalities it provides to users. Function Points serve as a standardized unit of measurement, allowing for the estimation of effort, cost, and resources required for software development and maintenance.
I.	External Inputs (EI): Inputs provided by users or external systems that initiate processing within the software system.
II.	External Outputs (EO): Outputs produced by the software system in response to user or external system requests.
III.	External Inquiries (EQ): Inquiries made by users or external systems that result in data retrieval from the software system.
IV.	Internal Logical Files (ILF): Data maintained by the software system and used for processing.
V.	External Interface Files (EIF): Data used by the software system but maintained by external applications.

4.1.1 Assigning Values
I.	There are 10 External Inputs (EI) required for user interactions such as registration, login, browsing menus, placing orders, etc.
II.	There are 5 External Outputs (EO) generated by the system, including order confirmation, payment confirmation, feedback submission confirmation, etc.
III.	There are 3 External Inquiries (EQ) required for functionalities like order status inquiries, menu availability inquiries, etc.
IV.	There are 4 Internal Logical Files (ILF) representing data maintained by the system, including customer data, order data, feedback data, etc.
V.	There are 2 External Interface Files (EIF) representing data used by the system but maintained by external applications, such as payment gateway data.

4.1.2 Weighting Factors:
A (External Inputs): 4
B (External Outputs): 5
C (External Inquiries): 4
D (Internal Logical Files): 7
E (External Interface Files): 5
FP=(EI×A) +(EO×B) +(EQ×C) +(ILF×D) +(EIF×E)
FP= (10×4) +(5×5) +(3×4) +(4×7) +(2×5)
FP=40+25+12+28+10
FP=115

4.2 Efforts
Effort=A×(FP) **E ×(KLOC) **F
•	Efforts is the effort required to complete the project (person-months).
•	FP is the total Function Points calculated.
•	KLOC is the estimated lines of code (thousands of lines of code).
•	A, E, and F are scaling factors dependent on the project type and environment.

Since you have Function Points, we'll need to estimate lines of code (KLOC) based on the FP. A commonly used conversion factor is:
KLOC = FP/1000

For the scaling factors A, E, and F, we'll use standard values based on the project type and development mode. For example, for a semi-detached development mode (between organic and embedded), typical values are:

A = 2.8
E = 0.91
F = 0.67
Effort=2.8 × (115) **0.91 × (0.115) ** 0.67
Effort≈2.8×26.91×0.407
Effort≈30.150 person-months
So, based on the Intermediate COCOMO model, the estimated effort required to complete your project is approximately 30.150 person-months.

4.3	Schedule:
The project schedule outlines the timeline and sequence of activities required to complete the "Online Food Delivery" website development project. It specifies when each task or milestone will be completed, helping to manage resources, track progress, and ensure timely delivery of the project.

4.4 Risk Table
Risk ID	Risk Description	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level	Mitigation Strategy
R1	Delay in requirements gathering	High	High	High	Conduct thorough stakeholder interviews and document requirements early in the project.
R2	Technical challenges	Medium	High	Medium-High	Hire experienced developers and conduct regular technical reviews to identify and address challenges early.
R3	Scope creep	High	High	High	Establish a change management process to review and approve scope changes before implementation.
R4	Resource constraints	Medium	High	Medium-High	Continuously monitor resource utilization and adjust project timelines or allocate additional resources as needed.
R5	Third-party dependencies	Medium	High	Medium-High	Identify critical third-party dependencies early and have contingency plans in place in case of delays or issues.
